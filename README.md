# Boilerplate for Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Styled Components + Redux + Axios

I have implemented SSR(Server Side Rendering) on homepage for demo purpose. The tools available for you out of the box with this boilerplate:

- Next.js (v12.2.0)
- React.js (v18.2.0)
- TypeScript (v4.5.2)
- Tailwind CSS (v2.2.19)
- Styled-components (v5.3.3)
- twin.macro (v2.8.2)
- React Redux (v7.2.6)
- Axios (v0.24.0)

## Requirements

- Node.js

## Getting started

Run the following commands on your local environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/ABee-Tech/nextjs-typescript-boilerplate.git <YOUR-APP-NAME>

cd <YOUR-APP-NAME>

npm install
```

Optionally, You have to copy and rename `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local`, if you want to put your API's base URL on environment variable:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL='https://your-base-url.com/api'
```

Now, You can run your app locally in development mode with live hot reload:

```
npm run dev
```
